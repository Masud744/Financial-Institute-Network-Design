# Financial Institute Network Design

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a secure, scalable, and efficient network for financial institutions. The design ensures smooth operations across multiple departments while addressing critical requirements like security, scalability, and high availability.

## Key Features
- **Hierarchical Network Design:** Implemented a three-tier architecture for scalability and redundancy.
- **VLAN Segmentation:** Department-wise isolation to enhance security and traffic optimization.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Secure communication between segmented networks.
- **Dynamic IP Allocation:** Configured DHCP for efficient device management.
- **Routing Protocol (OSPF):** Used for dynamic and efficient routing.
- **Secure WAN Connectivity:** Ensured external server access (DNS, DHCP, Web, Email).
- **Load Balancing:** Achieved high availability with dual ISPs.
- **VoIP Configuration:** Enabled seamless communication using IP telephony.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Cisco Packet Tracer:** For simulation and validation.
- **Routing Protocols:** OSPF for efficient network communication.
- **NAT & PAT Configuration:** For secure internet access.
